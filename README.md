## 1. Apriori Algorithm
Algorithm to generate frequent itemsets of increasing size with a given minimum support count constraint along with association rules for the same with a given minimum confidence constraint.

## 2. Classification Algorithm (ID3)
Algorithm to classify rows of data based on the information provided in a single target or result column. Iteratively generates nodes for the decision tree by determining column providing maximum information gained on splitting dataset on the column at mean value. Assigns target class to each node for classification.
